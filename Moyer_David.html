				<h3><p>In my free time, I like to play videogames, exercise, work on my computer, and hang out with friends!</p>
					
			
				<p>I built my first computer back in 2015 because I wanted to be able
				more videogames and that it where my passion for computing was found. Since then,
				I've been researching more about computers and looking for more stuff to learn
				about the subject.</p>
